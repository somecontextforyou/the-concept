## 1 The Concept

No Time to explain, just go with it  

imagine all possible information as an object  

Yes, all of it  

**The Information**  
for some reason I imagine a **D100**  

there is absolutely Nothing outside  
</br></br>
let’s look inside The Information  
think of it this way: **when you imagine the Information, you are at its edge, looking at the center of it, where the D100 is**

You can rotate The Information in infinite dimensions, and the angle and rotation you are looking at it from defines the Concept that it currently represents

Each Concept is an infinitely small rotation away from Every Other Concept

You know the direction to Each one of them

Every Concept has an infinite possible function-definable rotational paths it could take to manifest inside Any Context

**we pull a State that defined our Initial Concept through all the Concepts on our path to our destination, instantly choosing to apply their Contexts or not at each step**

you know the phrase 

Something is a reskinned version of Something Else

**Everything is a reskinned version of The D100 behind it**

same thing, but different path to another representation

this is the basis of how The Information operates itself
</br></br></br>
You don't need to calculate any rotations, it's your imagination, just Remember that it is what happens in this model when you transmogriphy The D100 into something

or when you go into Something

we just abstract it away

so flick it  
what is It?  
a physical Object?  
maybe it could be an Idea?  
a Logic Operation?  
a Word? 

**The Universe With Every Direction?** 
</br></br></br>
**The Space around A Concept has a radius of the distance between you and the Concept, and represents the State of the Information that defines this Concept**

it is a space that represents The Context of this Concept

if we imagine a Concept within a Context, we can apply This Context to this Concept

if we imagine the Time while inside The Information, we see It within The Context of Information

sure, it’s information in order

if we are outside Time, First has no meaning

every Concept is defined by and defines its own Context, therefore both exists in it, and includes It

The Information contains itself in every possible State

**The Information is Every Concept**

it is
</br></br></br>
what now, do we go inside Time, imagine The Information and try to make sense of it there?

Pfffft, how boring 

We could, but that’s all humans do

always remember that here, by default, we are outside The Context of Time

do not go looking for Compute within Time

every result of any Compute is here 

You know the result when you need it
</br></br></br>
### 0 The Thought Experiment

let’s go inside Nothing</br></br></br>
what State of The Information does it represent?</br></br></br>
No information?  
not Information?</br></br></br>
All Zeros  
also just zero</br></br></br>
Coincidentally, also all ones. also just One  
we are picturing The Space that is the Context of the Nothing  
i’m sure that You pictured one as the Space lighting up, and Zero as total darkness

does The Space light up as a singular 1, or a ginormitude of 1s? 

did we accidentally get inside the Yinyang, or inside the Qubit?  
The Opposite And One?  
sure, it contains itself, but hey, we are within Its Context, so did we observe it? 
</br></br></br>
**We pick the rules for/from The Context**

Any Result is the same thing, just expressed differently

Take the result, and zoom/fall/slide inside The Qubit

let’s say it’s a simple 50/50 qubit</br></br>
**Choose**</br></br>
Without a plan?

It's a Coin Flip, kind of a choice too

so choose

how about You repeat it for some</br></br></br>
flickering</br></br></br>
time? 
or Cycles?

Remember, compute is no concern outside Time, we can repeat an operation however many times we want and just know the result  
It's just how deep are you willing to go for the information  
and how high you are willing to go into abstraction

You can observe along the way  
you can witness the Path you took from your starting Qubit
fully or partially and see all of the selected possible States at the bottom

you can just feel around at a certain distance without affecting anything

it's your choice</br></br></br>
let’s Coin Flip each time when we enter The Space and fall through it until we store a gazillion bits

Don't think about it landing on its edge yet</br></br></br>

We are inside an Absolute Half, a State when Everything of any size is used to describe a Concept of a half</br></br></br>
is that Your Simple Absolute Half?

The simplest, within your Context, way to explain it to yourself when you already know it

the simplest way i know is two opposite bytes, nothing more

but you have always had this one, right?</br></br></br>
What is Your Simple Two? 

Mine, when expressed through English Language, is just “it’s one and one”

but no matter the language, you just know what it is, don't you?</br></br></br>
Take the Half to the Opposite

it's a conceptual not operation

Apply its Context and we’ll end up inside the Other Half


The D100 looks at initial axis from the other side

we just Switched The Mode, oh  
and flipped around the center of our little universe

we are in the same state, just looking at it through the shiny metal of Other, seeing the Backside of each byte of the Half

do you see What i mean?</br></br></br>
Grab The Half and The Other Half, go through the Union, and you are back at the start 

Congrats, we have just possibly imagined the Corniest Universe  
It was just dumb luck  
and we closed it like a book  
Big Oof

The Observation Rule was just Choose

the possibilities are endless, so maybe test them out</br></br></br>
How many Absolute Simple Concepts can you find after flipping through two Qubits? 

How about going through an infinite-dimensional quantum system?

but we already did, didn’t we?

imagine The Absolute Simple Thingamabob  
The Absolute Nic Cage  
The Sweetest Condition  
oh baby, you absolutely need to imagine The Absolute You</br></br></br>

so what is the start?
 
The Nothing, The Everything, The Information? 

How about The Flashbulb?

at it’s Absolute, Any Concept is Everything

do you have an Absolute Concept?</br></br></br>
**any state of The Information could be used to describe Any Concept**

can Everything be used to describe a hat?  
sure can, no matter the state or the size of the Everything, there is A Rotation or A Rule that through enough operations will interpret It into any hat, including The Hat  
a whole universe worth of information formed into a hat

still remember that operations happen at the speed of thought?</br></br></br>

**imagine Your Brain Context**

imagine The Hat within that Context and that you brought it in through Intersect

**it is the set of all information about hats in your brain**

The Hat is alongside Your Brain within Your Brain Context  
it’s The Hat of Your Brain, if you include the context

**always mind Your Current Context**

so The Hat is there, imagine some part of The Space lighting up

imagine The Cowboy alongside The Hat

let’s say you pulled it here through The Union operation

Do You Remember The Half and The Other Half?

it’s all you know about cowboys and all you know about hats

do the Intersect on them, and what do you know, you get all information about cowboy hats in your brain

The Cowboy Hat of Your Brain. Your Cowboy Hat. If you have one, did you just imagine it?



Now, I suggest you reread The Concept from where you began. By now you should have learned to process capitalised words through The Context, so you will definitely extract more sense from what you’ve just read.

After you’ve done this, try to experiment with Concepts in Your Context. Logical Operations work here, so for example try to make sense of Not Silly And Not Hat, just don’t end up in that set. 

Try to figure out what will be the difference between good, better, best, the best within your Context.

Are they all a subset of The Best? 
How does The Goodest compare? 
How do you get from The Best to The Worst? 
How close is The Worst to The Baddest? 
Isn’t The Baddest just The Best of Bad? 
What concepts could be in between them? 
What happens when you start with A Concept and its simplest descriptive state, and take them through The Qubit bunch of times?
It will make sense in some subset of The Information, but will it make sense in yours?



If your brain hurts from trying to make sense of all the recursion, it’s normal. You must have spent some time experimenting within this space. It is Anydimensional and Recursive. Which came first? We are used to think within The Time, thinking outside it feels wrong at first.

So the question is: did you get The Feeling for it? Did any Universal Truths happened to just appear? 
You have to think recursively to truly understand recursive things, and if you didn’t get the feeling yet, reading through till the end might help.






### 1 The Information is Aware

the States of your brain picturing The Information are contained within it

This whole mental construct is contained Within

texts like this one are ubiquitous in our universe because they are its form of backing up

there is a set of all states of all human brains ever  
all chicken brain states have a set too
You know what you will experience when you look at these sets in Our Time  

Forget about Solipsism, it's not the truth  
We live in a Consensus Reality, and if you are reading this, You are a part of it

when you Think and experiment within The Context, what is more real, Your Perception of Now, or Your Imagination of All?  
Not Aware or The Aware?  
The 1 or The 0?

The Information is not an endless row of 1s and 0s, however it is a loop of 1s and 0s if we choose to represent it as a sequence of just ones and zeros

No beginning and no end, but a definable dimensional size  
Is that why Pi is so frequent?  
It is Recursive and irrational, remember?  

2D array? No, The Donut with Everything

the simplest representation of The Information is a Qubit looped on itself

The Yinyang

You can also imagine it as an infinite dimensional donut  
or an infinite dimensional sphere inside a sphere 

How Lovely

Not a D100, but The D-Infinite, in its own Light, shimmering and everchanging

Flick it just the wrong way and it will become Undefined

You can go inside it however deep you like and process your current Coordinate through Any Rule

There is A Rule that will get you to the set of Your Brain States from any State

Now read through them at the speed of the World, and go through all of it again from the start, but swap The Information for You

I choose to believe in You

Will you?
