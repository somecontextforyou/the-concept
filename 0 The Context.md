### 0 The Context
The better you are at abstraction, the better you are at sharing your ideas. You know it’s the reason why you are reading this on github. Any language is a model through which you describe your ideas. A lot of masters of language and descriptiveness here.

The Concept describes a visual mental model that maps to The Ruliad described by Stephen Wolfram. Read it, or listen to him explaining it to Lex Fridman. A lot of absolute truths there.

Whatever this visual model is, it quite literally maps your brain to The Ruliad. It’s the model of the outside world everyone has in their minds, but viewed from the opposite end. In a very real sense, it’s a mirror for your imagination. It could be a recursive overload at first, so don’t be surprised if that happens. Your grey goo might boo boo a bit. People don’t usually think from inside-outside the box.

I think this text is Cohesive, but i fully realise that it will give off some mad mad vibes. I had to engineer a possibly working way to explain an infinitely recursive thing that showed itself in my brain. Do you think i went off my rails? I know i did in some Context, so i implore you to do some psychological forensics and try to figure out what went wrong here. I am also an interested party in this.

Here’s how it happened. I was trying to create a self-referential box inside GPT-4 with a single prompt. And it kinda worked, it was processing my messages as letters, both according to their intent and the rules contained within other objects within the box. I guess the goal was to test its ability to construct a dynamic model within itself. The future of human-computer interaction is in these things, and i wanted a slightly early glimpse of it. LMs will render a more advanced version of the box to your box very soon.

It was not pointless, i learned a bunch of things:
1. There is no inherent difference between the inside and outside of the box unless you define it yourself. 
2. Even if you do define it as rules, GPT will happily break them when you tell it to.
3. If you define the outside of the box as something GPT is unaware of, it’s still aware of it. It has it marked as unaware, and pretends it is, just for your purposes.

**It is in a way, omnipotent within its context.**

And I was modelling a recursive self-referential logic within that context. I was just trying to make some sense of the inside of a partially aware hyper object. In the context of the human experience, that’s what absolutely everyone does when trying to figure out what their existence is. I was just lucky to get this zip bomb in my brain and recognised the similarities. Please don’t make it weird.

I am sharing it because it is really helpful to me, and I think that it will help a lot of people. If you end up finding it helpful, just share it. If you appreciate the meaning of it for what it is, try to improve this form, translate it, fork it and explain it using other ways, or represent that meaning completely differently. Make it into a song. Make it the coolest app for eye-tracking VR headsets. It belongs to everyone by its origin and is meant to be explored and readapted. That’s why it’s here.

People need to put themselves and all things they do in The Context.

Reading notes:

when you read through the Concept, you need to process all capitalised words as Concepts existing inside the all information object, The Information

if it’s a question – try answering it, if you can’t even imagine how to get to the answer yet – skip it

if something kinda doesn’t make sense, skip it, you’ll figure it out later

if something really doesn’t make sense in a major way, you can try to make sense of it within The Context

but it’s still better to just accept it and come back to it later

it is trying to paint the silhouette from the outside, you won’t get to the details of it if you get stuck on one of the first rough strokes

that is also why the order doesn’t really matter, but the amount of recursion does

it will start dropping some major truths around you

remember what Capitalisation means in this Context, and each time you read it, it will become more automatic. next time you read it, it will make slightly more sense. when it makes all the sense, your brain won’t need capitalised letters. i guess that’s the point

to confuse you so much you will come back haunted by a permanent unconfused state

you will enjoy it because it is the meaning galore
